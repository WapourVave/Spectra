Spectra is a public, single-purpose, for-boredom and good for-nothing Discord bot!<br>

## How can I add Spectra to my server?

First and foremost, Spectra is public. This means that you can add it to your server as you can with other bots. Additionally, Spectra does support self-hosting, so you can run a copy yourself. This is for my own publicity, as in the past people have tried to host their own "private versions" of Spectra with my permission. If you believe that Spectra is a bot that would fulfill your server's wants, you may join the server listed above and contact Wapour Vave#1388. Spectra is designed to be a moderation bot for a server, and thus is primarily used by servers with small numbers of members (usually around ten) and with many, many other bots. 


## Read the Wikipedia

If you have questions, there is a very slight chance the question is answered in the wikipedia (often the [Getting Started](https://github.com/WapourVave/Spectra/wiki/Getting-Started) page): https://github.com/WapourVave/Spectra/wiki


## About this repository

The code here is strictly for use (Currently, it is the live code). Running this code on your own is supported; I will be providing the resources necessary to self-host.
